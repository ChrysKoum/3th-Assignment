                            for an organism. Food is usually of plant, animal, or
                            fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins,
                            vitamins, or minerals. The
                            substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide
                            energy, maintain life, or
                            stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that
                            satisfy the needs of their unique
                            metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical
                            contexts.

                            Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different
                            ecosystems. Historically,
                            humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. As
                            agricultural technologies
                            increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture
                            opportunities in their
                            geography. Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and
                            culinary arts, including a
                            wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes. As cultures have mixed
                            through forces like
                            international trade and globalization, ingredients have become more widely available beyond
                            their geographic and
                            cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and
                            practices.

                            Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the
                            world is supplied by the
                            industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it
                            through complex food
                            processing and food distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies
                            heavily on fossil fuels, which
                            means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate
                            change, accountable for as much
                            as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions.[1] Addressing the carbon intensity of the food
                            system and food waste are
                            important mitigation measures in the global response to climate change.

                            The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues
                            including: sustainability,
                            biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food. The
                            right to food is a human right
                            derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR),
                            recognizing the "right to an
                            adequate standard of living, including adequate food", as well as the "fundamental right to
                            be free from hunger".
                            Because of these fundamental rights, food security is often a priority international policy
                            activity; for example
                            Sustainable Development Goal 2 "Zero hunger" is meant to eliminate hunger by 2030. Food
                            safety and food security are
                            monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection,
                            World Resources Institute,
                            World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information
                            Council, and are often
                            subject to national regulation by institutions, like the Food and Drug Administration in the
                            United States.
